# CHESS PROJECT

Program to implement functions to compute the possible moves a given piece can make in an empty chess board given the current position of the piece.

Using these functions find whether a given piece can attack another piece, given the positions of the 2 pieces.

# FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTED:

1. knight\_movements(): Accepts the current position of the Knight as argument, computes the possible moves it can make and returns the possible final positions as a list of strings.
  

2. rook\_movements(): Accepts the current position of the Rook as argument, computes the possible moves it can make and returns the possible final positions as a list of strings.
  

3. queen\_movements(): Accepts the current position of the queen as argument, computes the possible moves it can make and returns the possible final positions as a list of strings.
  

4. bishop\_movements(): Accepts the current position of the Bishop as argument, computes the possible moves it can make and returns the possible final positions as a list of strings.
  

5. can\_cut(): Accepts 2 pieces and their current positions as argument and returns whether a piece can cut the other or not.
